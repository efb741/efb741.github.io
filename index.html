    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>
        I am Elizabeth, a full-stack software engineer with five years of experience creating modern web applications (though you probably wouldn't guess that from the state of this website!). I mainly use .NET, Angular, and T-SQL professionally. I enjoy learning and creating new things.

    <p>
        Right now, I am playing around and seeing what I can do using GitHub Pages. Eventually, though, I hope to use this space to showcase some of my work. Please come back soon!
